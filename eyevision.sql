(2, 'How the Eye Works', '<p>Light\r\n rays enter the eye through the cornea, the clear front window of the \r\neye. The cornea  refractive power bends the light rays in such a way \r\nthat they pass freely through the pupil the opening in the center of the\r\n iris through which light enters the&nbsp;eye.</p>\r\n<p>The iris works like a shutter in a camera. It has the ability to \r\nenlarge and shrink, depending on how much light is entering the eye.</p>\r\n<p>After passing through the iris, the light rays pass thru the eyeâ€™s \r\nnatural crystalline lens. This clear, flexible structure works like the \r\nlens in a camera, shortening and lengthening its width in order to focus\r\n light rays properly.</p>\r\n<p>Light rays pass through a dense, transparent gel-like substance, \r\ncalled the vitreous that fills the globe of the eyeball and helps the \r\neye hold its spherical shape.</p>\r\n<p>In a normal eye, the light rays come to a sharp focusing point on the\r\n retina. The retina functions much like the film in a camera. It is \r\nresponsible for capturing all of the light rays, processing them into \r\nlight impulses through millions of tiny nerve endings, then sending \r\nthese light impulses through over a million nerve fibers to the optic \r\nnerve.</p>\r\n<p>Because the keratoconus cornea is irregular and cone shaped, light \r\nrays enter the eye at different angles, and do not focus on one point \r\nthe retina, but on many different points causing a blurred, distorted \r\nimage.</p>\r\n<p>In summary, the cornea is the clear, transparent front covering which\r\n admits light and begins the refractive process. It also keeps foreign \r\nparticles from entering the eye.</p>\r\n<p>The pupil is an adjustable opening that controls the intensity of \r\nlight permitted to strike the lens. The lens focuses light through the \r\nvitreous humor, a clear gel-like substance that fills the back of the \r\neye and supports the retina.</p>\r\n<p><img alt="Eye Health | Human Eye Diagram | NKCF" src="https://www.nkcf.org/images/stories/cornea3.jpg" align="right" height="293" width="418">The\r\n retina receives the image that the cornea focuses through the eyeâ€™s \r\ninternal lens and transforms this image into electrical impulses that \r\nare carried by the optic nerve to the brain. We can tolerate very large \r\nscars on our bodies with no concern except for our vanity. This is not \r\nso in the cornea. Even a minor scar or irregularity in the shape can \r\nimpair vision. No matter how well the rest of the eye is functioning, if\r\n the cornea is scarred, clouded or distorted, vision will be affected.</p>\r\n<p>In keratoconus, the irregular shape of the cornea does not allow it \r\nto do its job correctly, leading to distortion of the image it passed to\r\n the retina and transmitted to the brain.</p>\r\n<h2>THE CORNEA</h2>\r\n<p>The eye is enclosed by a tough white sac, the sclera. The cornea is \r\nthe transparent window in this white sac which allows the objects you \r\nare looking at to be carried in the form of light waves into the \r\ninterior of the eye.</p>\r\n<p>The surface of the cornea is where light begins its journey into the \r\neye. The corneaâ€™s mission is to gather and focus visual images. Because \r\nit is out front, like the windshield of an automobile, it is subject to \r\nconsiderable abuse from the outside world.</p>\r\n<p>The cornea is masterfully engineered so that only the most expensive \r\nmanmade lenses can match its precision. The smoothness and shape of the \r\ncornea, as well as its transparency, is vitally important to the proper \r\nfunctioning of the eye. If either the surface smoothness or the clarity \r\nof the cornea suffers, vision will be disrupted.</p>\r\n<h2>CORNEAL LAYERS</h2>\r\n<div align="center">\r\n<div>\r\n<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img alt="Corneal Health | How Does The Human Eye Work" src="https://www.nkcf.org/images/stories/corneal-layers2.jpg" height="426" width="500"><p class="wp-caption-text">A cross-section of the Cornea showing distinct layers</p></div>\r\n<div style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">Although\r\n appearing to be one clear membrane, the cornea is composed of five \r\ndistinct layers of tissue, each with its own function.</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<ul><li><strong>Epithelium</strong>&nbsp;is the thin outermost layer of fast-growing and easily-regenerated cells.</li><li><strong>Bowmanâ€™s layer&nbsp;</strong>consists of irregularly-arranged collagen fibers&nbsp;and protects the corneal stroma.

The stability of the tear film \r\nreduces with age and poor eyelid health (eg blepharitis) and results in \r\nthe uncomfortable feeling of grit or sand in the eyes.

People who suffer from tear film instability may \r\nalso experience watery eyes due to excessive tear production in response\r\n to poor tear film stability.

<h3>Immediately after cataract surgery</h3>
<p>Before you leave the day surgery, you will be prescribed eye drops or other medication to prevent infection, reduce inflammation and control eye pressure. You will need to have a family member or friend with you to take you home. Once you get home, it is recommended that you rest your eyes and nap. Several hours post surgery, most people are able to watch some television or look at a computer screen for a short period of time. Because cataract surgery is only performed on one eye at a time, you may notice an imbalance in your vision until the second eye is operated on (from 1–4 weeks later).</p>
<h3>Days after cataract surgery</h3>
<p>It is normal for vision to be blurry in the beginning – your eye needs to heal and adjust. Vision will normally begin to improve within a few days of the surgery. It’s also normal for your eye to feel itchy and to experience mild discomfort for a couple of days – your doctor will ask you to wear an eye patch or protective shield at night to ensure you don’t rub your eye while you sleep. This discomfort should disappear after a few days.</p>'),
